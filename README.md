# Portfolio Management Application

A responsive, dynamic, single-page application built with **Next.js** and **FastAPI** for creating and managing multimedia portfolios. This implementation demonstrates modern full-stack development practices with advanced file handling, state management, and UI/UX design.

## 🚀 Implementation Status

### ✅ **Completed Features**

#### Frontend (Next.js + React + TypeScript)
- **📁 Advanced File Upload**: Drag & drop interface with real-time preview, progress tracking, and comprehensive validation
- **🎨 Portfolio Management**: Complete CRUD operations with live preview and responsive design
- **📱 Modern UI/UX**: Mobile-first design with animations, modal system, and toast notifications
- **🗂️ Section Organization**: Expandable/collapsible sections with drag-and-drop item management
- **⚡ State Management**: Zustand store with local storage persistence and optimistic updates
- **🔄 API Integration**: Full REST API client with error handling and data transformation

#### Backend (FastAPI + MongoDB)
- **🛡️ Robust File Handling**: Multi-format support (images/videos) with FFmpeg video processing
- **📊 Rich Data Models**: Comprehensive Pydantic models with validation and metadata extraction
- **🗄️ Database Integration**: MongoDB with Motor for async operations and proper error handling
- **🎬 Media Processing**: Automatic thumbnail generation, metadata extraction, and file optimization
- **🧹 File Management**: Automatic cleanup, UUID-based naming, and safe file operations

### ❌ **Missing Critical Feature: User Authentication & Multi-Tenancy**

**The application currently lacks user authentication and multi-tenancy**, which was a core requirement. This means:
- All portfolios are globally accessible
- No user registration/login system
- No data isolation between users
- No authorization or access control

This represents the primary unfinished portion of the project.

## 🔎 **AI Tools Disclosure**

This project was built using AI coding assistance. Every line of code has been reviewed and can be explained in detail, demonstrating understanding of:
- Modern React patterns and state management
- FastAPI best practices and async programming
- Database design and optimization
- File handling and media processing
- TypeScript type safety and validation

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Python 3.8+
